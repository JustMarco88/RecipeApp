# Collaborative Recipe Design with AI

## Core Concept
A dynamic, interactive recipe creation process where AI provides initial structure, and the user can:
- Receive AI-generated recipe outlines
- Interactively modify and refine recipes
- Leverage AI suggestions while maintaining full user control

## Collaborative Design Workflow

### 1. Initial Recipe Generation
- User provides basic concept or ingredient set
- AI generates initial recipe draft with:
  * Suggested ingredients
  * Preliminary cooking steps
  * Estimated cooking times
  * Potential flavor profiles
  * Nutritional considerations

### 2. Interactive Editing Mode
#### Collaborative Editing Features
- Inline editing of AI-suggested content
- Real-time AI feedback on modifications
- Suggestion chips for:
  * Ingredient substitutions
  * Technique improvements
  * Flavor enhancement
  * Cooking method alternatives

### 3. AI Assistance Layers
- Contextual suggestions based on:
  * Ingredient compatibility
  * Cooking technique expertise
  * Cultural culinary traditions
  * Nutritional balance
- Proactive recommendations:
  * "This substitution might alter texture"
  * "Consider reducing cooking time"
  * "This spice combination could enhance flavor"

### 4. Knowledge Validation
- User can mark AI suggestions as:
  * Accepted
  * Rejected
  * Partially modified
- AI learns from user's cooking preferences
- Builds personalized recipe design assistant

## Technical Implementation Considerations
- Low-latency AI interaction
- Incremental API calls
- Caching of common suggestions
- Minimal token usage

## Interaction Modes
### Guided Creation
- Step-by-step recipe development
- AI provides structured guidance

### Free-form Editing
- Complete user control
- AI as a background consultant

## Example Interaction Flow
1. User inputs: "Mediterranean chicken dish"
2. AI generates base recipe
3. User modifies ingredients
4. AI suggests technique improvements
5. User adjusts cooking method
6. Final recipe refined collaboratively

## AI Prompt Engineering Strategies
- Context-aware prompting
- Preserve user's culinary intent
- Provide nuanced, helpful suggestions
- Avoid overly prescriptive recommendations

## Advanced Features (Future)
- Learn user's cooking style
- Predict preferred modifications
- Generate personalized recipe variations
- Cultural and dietary preference adaptation
