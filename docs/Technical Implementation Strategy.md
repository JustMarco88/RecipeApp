# Technical Implementation Strategy

## Recommended Technology Stack
### Frontend
- Framework: React with Next.js
  * Provides server-side rendering
  * Excellent mobile and web responsiveness
  * Strong ecosystem for PWA development
- State Management: Zustand or Jotai (lightweight state management)
- UI Component Library: Shadcn/UI or Radix UI
  * Provides accessible, customizable components
  * Supports rapid prototyping
  * Easy dark/light mode implementation

### Backend
- Language: TypeScript with Node.js
- Framework: tRPC with Prisma
  * Provides type-safe API development
  * Seamless backend-frontend type integration
- Database: 
  * Primary: PostgreSQL (via Supabase or direct hosting)
  * Caching: Redis

### AI Integration
- Primary LLM API: Anthropic Claude API
- AI Service Layer:
  * Dedicated microservice for AI interactions
  * Caching of common AI-generated results
  * Fallback and rate limiting mechanisms

### Hosting and Infrastructure
- Vercel or Netlify for frontend deployment
- Railway or Render for backend services
- Cloudflare for global CDN and edge caching

## AI Integration Strategy with Anthropic
### Initial Implementation
1. Recipe Parsing
   - Use Claude to standardize recipe formats
   - Extract structured data from unstructured recipes
   - Suggest ingredient substitutions

2. Cooking Assistant Features
   - Generate cooking tips
   - Provide step-by-step guidance
   - Nutritional information estimation

### Technical Considerations
- Implement strict prompt engineering
- Use caching to reduce API costs
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Clear error handling

## Performance and Scalability Considerations
- Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Use server-side rendering for initial load
- Implement efficient client-side caching
- Design for offline functionality

## Cost Management for AI API
- Implement request caching
- Use batch processing where possible
- Monitor and optimize API usage
- Implement usage tracking and alerts

## Security Considerations
- Use Anthropic's API with secure token management
- Implement client-side encryption for sensitive data
- No storage of raw LLM responses
- Minimal data collection approach
