# Intuitive Recipe Evolution Tracking Design

## Core Tracking Philosophy
- Minimal friction for input
- Quick, contextual annotation
- Preserve cooking intuition
- Low cognitive overhead

## Annotation Modes

### 1. Quick Modification Tagging
- Floating '+' button during recipe view
- Rapid annotation types:
  * Ingredient tweak
  * Technique change
  * Timing adjustment
  * Flavor note
- Takes <5 seconds to log

### 2. Contextual Modification Capture
#### During Cooking Mode
- Inline annotation points
- Each recipe step has:
  * Optional quick note
  * Optional photo attachment
  * Difficulty rating
- Context-specific prompts
  * "How did this step feel?"
  * "Any surprises?"

### 3. Post-Cooking Reflection
- Optional detailed review screen
- Guided but non-mandatory reflection
- Sections like:
  * Overall experience
  * What worked
  * What to change next time
  * Potential future variations

## Technical UX Considerations
- Default to minimal tracking
- Progressive disclosure of detail
- Machine learning to suggest when to capture
- One-tap logging mechanisms

## Modification Visualization
- Simple timeline view
- Color-coded changes
- Optional detailed drill-down
- Trends and pattern recognition

## Precision Tracking Approach
### Measurement Variance Tracking
- Automatic detection of measurement differences
- Subtle indicators of deviation
- Optional precise logging
- Learns user's personal adjustment patterns

## Privacy and Control
- Complete user control over tracking
- Easy deletion of iterations
- Export/import of recipe evolution
- Anonymous, local-first approach

## Intelligent Suggestions
- Contextual, non-intrusive recommendations
- Based on observed cooking patterns
- Optional AI insights

## Performance Optimization
- Lightweight logging mechanism
- Efficient storage
- Minimal performance impact
